This project was created as a one day code challenge. The simple Kanban board was built on top of a Vue CLI template. You can see all the code changes in [this commit](https://github.com/mabarbeau/simple-kanban/commit/289992c1aa2f7e6b368cfbd6959ed4d4db469d51). The Kanban board utilises local storage to preserve state.
